**GOAL** 

Develop the 2D online shooter client capable of handling login/registration, matchmaking, and gameplay communication with the servers.

**How I resolved it** 

I implemented the client in C++ using Visual Studio. The client communicates with the Service Server via TCP for authentication, version checks, and matchmaking, and with the Game Server via UDP for real-time gameplay. The client manages player input and map loading from text files.

**What I learned** 

I learned how to design a game client for online multiplayer, synchronize actions and animations across different clients, and apply prediction techniques to reduce the perception of latency.
